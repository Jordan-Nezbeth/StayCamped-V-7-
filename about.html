      <h2>👋 Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        We’re changing how America camps — one setup at a time. StayCamped was born from a simple idea: camping should be easy, exciting, and accessible. Whether you're new to the outdoors or a lifelong camper, we strive to enhance the experience from both sides. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We give campers a way to enjoy the outdoors without the towing, setup, or storage — and we give camper owners a way to earn extra income by renting their RVs out at real campgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in a family-owned camper dealership and saw two major issues:
      </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #ffd384;">
        “I want to camp, but I don’t own a camper.”<br />
        “I own a camper, but I hardly use it — and it’s not paying for itself.”
      </p>
      <p>
        StayCamped solves both. It’s the bridge between campers who want the experience and owners who want a return on their investment.
      </p>

      <h2>🚀 Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To simplify camping for everyone — by connecting people to pre-set RV experiences, empowering owners to earn, and bringing the outdoors within reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’re solving real problems with real experience. Backed by:
      </p>

        <li>✅ A lifetime in the camping industry</li>
        <li>✅ A trusted camper network</li>
        <li>✅ Real inventory</li>
        <li>✅ A founder who’s all-in and growing this from the ground up</li>
      </ul>
